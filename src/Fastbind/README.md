2. While the prompt is showing, when you move your cursor over any action bar slot, spell, or item it'll show what keys or key combinations are bound to it.
3. You can then press any key or key combination to add a new binding or right-click it to clear the existing ones.
4. Finally press **Save** to commit or **Discard** to undo the changes.

## Uninstall

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore your keybindings.
