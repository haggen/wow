## About

...

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\*\Interface\AddOns`. If your game is already running you'll need to type `/reload`.

## Usage

After installing the add-on, your character and target frames will reset to the center of the screen as the default position. Their movement and lock state will now mirror each other.

If you had moved the frames before installing this add-on, you may want to reset their location using the right-click menu.

Please be aware that the add-on won't function during combat.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Reelease` folder from your add-ons directories.

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore the frames' position. For that, you'll have to use the right-click menu.
