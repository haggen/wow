## About

![Gif showing off the add-on in action](https://i.imgur.com/WHc1hCv.gif)

**Tunnelvision** resets both your character's and target's frames position to the center of the screen and then ties them together so when you drag one the other follows in a symmetrical fashion. It's simple stuff but helps you keep an eye on resources and cooldowns during the most stressful moments and also with your OCD. ;)

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns` prior to launching the game.

## Usage

Upon logging in after the add-on's been installed the default position of your character's and target's frames will be set to the center of the screen. Their position and locking mechanism will be tied together so that whatever happens to one will also be applied to the other.

If you have moved the frames prios to the installation of this add-on you might want to reset their position via the right-click menu.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Tunnelvision` folder from your add-ons directory.

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore your character's and target's frames position. For that you'll need to reset their position via the right-click menu and selecting Move Frame → Reset Position.
