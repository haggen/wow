# Threatrack

> Warn about PvP threats nearby.

## About

**Threatrack** continually scans for hostile player activity around you, informing whenever it can, who they are and how many.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns` before launching the game.

## Usage

You don't need to do anything. **Threatrack** just sits on the top part of your screen, ever watchful. Whenever an enemy player presence is detected, a picture of their Class will appear, along with their level, if it's either available or can be guessed. If you hover your cursor over the picture a tooltip with more information will appear, such as the player's name and Race.

When there's too many players, it'll collapse into stacked mode, where it'll only show one picture for each Class detected, and the tooltip will now display a list of players.

After a while with no further activity, their presence is considered stale and the corresponding pictures are removed from the screen.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Threatrack` folder from your add-ons directory.
