# Focus

> Bring your character's health as well your target's health closer to the center of the screen.

## Usage

Move the add-on directory `Focus` into `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` before launching the game. After it's installed both your charater's health and your target's health are going to appear just above the center of the screen. Type `/focus` if you want to move them around. You can drag your character's health around and the target's health will mirror its movement across the vertical axis.

Please note that **uninstalling the add-on won't restore your character's and target's health position**. That's because it's being handled by the _layout cache_ of the game. To **restore the default settings** use `/focus reset`.
